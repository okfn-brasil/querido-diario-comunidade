# Maintaining

## Responsibilities of a *Querido Diário* maintainer

- Always justify a suggestion according to the practices already adopted in the project, legibility and simplicity. It is essential that a civic project have as simple a structure as possible for beginners;
- The project must be tested before a Pull Request is merged;
- If a Pull Request has too many commits and the messages are unclear, use the "Squash and Merge" option when merging. If the discipline of version history management is good, this won't be necessary.

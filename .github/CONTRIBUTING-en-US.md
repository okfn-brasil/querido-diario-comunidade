Each repository may have specific details outlined in its respective documentation. Once you have completed the review of these general guidelines, be sure to also read the relevant repository-specific documents.[`CONTRIBUTING.mdof`](https://github.com/okfn-brasil/querido-diario-comunidade/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING-en-US.md). It is important to read the documentation specific to the repository of interest before making your contribution.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the terms specified therein.

## How to contribute

If you have not yet contributed to an open source project or are not familiar with this project, there are tasks for people like you in the 
[Issues](https://github.com/okfn-brasil/querido-diario-comunidade/issues) tab, labeled as [`good first issues`](https://github.com/okfn-brasil/querido-diario-comunidade/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"good+first+issue").

If any of those interest you, before starting, you can leave comments to ask any relevant questions and then leave a notice that you will be working on that task.

We also have a [discussion forum](https://github.com/okfn-brasil/querido-diario-comunidade/discussions) where you can contribute ideas related to the project.

And a [community on Discord](https://bit.ly/discord-ok), if you want to ask questions faster or talk to people who are also interested in Open Knowledge Brasil's civic innovation projects.

# Milistones

If there are no open issues or if none of them pique your interest, take a look at the Milestones in the repository of interest. Milestones indicate the goals to be achieved. Exploring the files to find areas for improvement that can help the repository reach a milestone is an excellent way to contribute.

-If you find such an area for improvement, open an issue describing the perceived possibility for enhancement. If you plan to undertake the task, mention it in your message.

# Discussions
If you have an idea or suggestion for the project's direction, create a Discussion.

-As Querido Diário consists of multiple repositories, and discussions often have a cross-cutting nature, it is a management decision to keep them centralized. To initiate or follow discussions, simply visit the [Discussion](https://github.com/okfn-brasil/querido-diario-comunidade/discussions).

# Community Chat
Ingresse na [comunidade](https://discord.com/channels/753035511609950280/986425635012485191). Lá você poderá tirar dúvidas mais rápidas, interagir com as pessoas mantenedoras, perguntar como poderia ajudar e ainda conversar com outras pessoas que também contribuem.

# Interacting with the code reviewer

- Be patient and allow the reviewer some time. Code reviews are inherently complex and time-consuming, and the reviewer, like you, may be another contributor offering their personal time when available or may have other priorities before they can review your code.
- Whether in the form of code or through messages with questions and suggestions, facilitate interaction by being concise but providing details when necessary.

## Keeping

## Responsibilities of a *Querido Diário* maintainer

- Respect the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT-en-US.md) and ensure that people have a safe and welcoming environment and that any victim of violation of this term has a channel of help;
- Always justify a suggestion according to the practices already adopted in the project, legibility and simplicity. It is essential that a civic project have as simple a structure as possible for beginners;
- The project must be tested before a Pull Request is merged;
- If a Pull Request has too many commits and the messages are unclear, use the "Squash and Merge" option when merging. If the discipline of version history management is good, this won't be necessary.

Querido Diário
==============

The Querido Diário (QD) project aims to classify, contextualize, and expand the
information contained in **official gazettes of the Brazilian municipal executive
branch**, making them available in an open and accessible format.

The tool seeks to facilitate the monitoring, analysis, and correlation of information
published in these gazettes, fostering the development of civic technology in Brazil
and promoting social accountability to find solutions for public sector challenges.

To achieve this, QD provides data on its `web platform`_, for general and on-demand
use through a search interface, and also through its `API`_ (Application Programming
Interface), to make it easier to develop solutions that utilize the data.

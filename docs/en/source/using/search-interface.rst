Search Interface
################

The Querido Diário search interface is a resource that allows users to search, in a
user-friendly way, the data that the project stores: the texts of official gazettes.
It is accessible through the `Querido Diário's web platform`_.

Learn how to use the search interface as you prefer, either by watching a recording
or through a textual tutorial, below.

.. attention::
    When sorting by **Relevance**, the first search results will be excerpts from
    gazettes with the greatest correspondence to the keywords used. In other words, the
    entire document is the most relevant and the excerpt is just one of the interesting
    passages from that edition.

And you can also download the **official gazette in original and/or open format**:

    :alt: Clicking on the "download official diary" button of the diary excerpt

.. tip::
    If the excerpt does not provide sufficient context, it is recommended to download the gazette (in the format you prefer)
    and perform a text search for any of the terms present in the excerpt.

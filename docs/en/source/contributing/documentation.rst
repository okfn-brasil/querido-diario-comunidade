Documentation 
###############

The project's technical documentation serves to help interested parties, users 
and developers understand the project, recording fundamental information and 
describing in more depth how Querido Diário works and what features it offers.

- **Repository**: https://github.com/okfn-brasil/querido-diario-comunidade
- **How to install and simulate the documentation**: `README`_

All official documentation (this *site*!) is generated from the repository's ``.rst`` files, 
built with the `Sphinx`_ documentation generator, using the
`sphinx-rtd-theme`_ theme, and is hosted on the `Read The Docs`_ service.

Each of the pages on this *site*, listed in the navigation menu, corresponds to 
a file of the same name in the ``/docs`` directory. You can also access the files 
via the "Edit on GitHub" link at the top of every page.

.. important::
    It is important that the documentation is up-to-date and relevant to the community.
    Don't hesitate to contribute *pull requests* (PRs) for adjustments, complements
    and additions, as well as translations into other languages.
